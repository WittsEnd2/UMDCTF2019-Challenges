# UMDCTF2019-Challenges
These are the challenges that I wrote for UMDCTF. They are web based challenges. If you are looking for the other challenges, go to [this repository](https://github.com/0xTowel/UMDCTF-2019-Challenges).

Note: the flags are encoded with sha-256. In order to verify the flag, run `echo -n "UMDCTF-{the_flag}" | sha256sum`(and the flags will be in the UMDCTF-{} format}.
